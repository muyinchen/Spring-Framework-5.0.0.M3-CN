## 5.4 Bean manipulation and the BeanWrapper

The `org.springframework.beans` package adheres to the JavaBeans standard provided by Oracle. A JavaBean is simply a class with a default no-argument constructor, which follows a naming convention where (by way of an example) a property named `bingoMadness` would have a setter method `setBingoMadness(..)`and a getter method `getBingoMadness()`. For more information about JavaBeans and the specification, please refer to Oracle’s website ( [javabeans](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/beans/package-summary.html)).

One quite important class in the beans package is the `BeanWrapper` interface and its corresponding implementation ( `BeanWrapperImpl`). As quoted from the javadocs, the `BeanWrapper` offers functionality to set and get property values (individually or in bulk), get property descriptors, and to query properties to determine if they are readable or writable. Also, the `BeanWrapper` offers support for nested properties, enabling the setting of properties on sub-properties to an unlimited depth. Then, the `BeanWrapper` supports the ability to add standard JavaBeans `PropertyChangeListeners` and `VetoableChangeListeners`, without the need for supporting code in the target class. Last but not least, the `BeanWrapper` provides support for the setting of indexed properties. The `BeanWrapper` usually isn’t used by application code directly, but by the `DataBinder` and the `BeanFactory`.

The way the `BeanWrapper` works is partly indicated by its name: *it wraps a bean* to perform actions on that bean, like setting and retrieving properties.
